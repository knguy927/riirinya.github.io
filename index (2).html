        <div class="subheading mb-5">PSYCHOLOGY ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">At the moment I am a freshmen attending the University of California, Riverside as a Psychology major planning to switch over to Managment of Psychology. Being a psychology major I am able to explore different concepts and theories surrounding the topic of psychology.Driven to pursue a career in the medical field, integrating a psychological perspective into patient care and mental health advocacy. Long-term goals include obtaining clinical psychology licensure and contributing to the understanding of trauma and resilience, particularly among young people and marginalized communities. I am committed to applying my academic and extracurricular experiences toward building a more compassionate and informed approach to mental health care. My involvement in clubs focused on mental health and well-being has required me to be both articulate and considerate, as I often needed to facilitate discussions on topics like stress, mental health stigma, and personal well-being. I strive to make all participants feel heard and respected, fostering inclusivity and open-mindedness in group settings. Additionally, I am skilled in presenting complex psychological concepts in an accessible and relatable way, a skill that has proven invaluable in both academic and peer mentorship contexts.

<br><br>

        A first-year psychology major at the University of California, Riverside, passionate about understanding human behavior and mental processes and committed to fostering well-being within diverse communities. Dedicated to exploring the intersection of mental health, social dynamics, and individual resilience, I bring a unique perspective rooted in experience and a desire to make a tangible difference through empathy-driven service and leadership. I am currently enrolled in foundational courses in psychology, human development, and social sciences to build a comprehensive understanding of psychological principles. I am particularly interested in developmental and clinical psychology, particularly how early experiences shape resilience and emotional regulation. I am seeking opportunities to engage in research, especially studies related to mental health, childhood development, and the role of mindfulness in stress management.
<br><br>

        With a strong background in leadership roles, I have effectively organized and executed numerous club activities, workshops, and community events, where I balanced empathy with structured planning to create impactful experiences. As President of two student clubs, I learned to delegate tasks, lead diverse teams, and motivate others toward shared goals. I fostered an inclusive environment by encouraging open dialogue, supporting peer development, and ensuring all members felt valued. These experiences taught me how to manage resources, time, and team dynamics under various circumstances, preparing me for future leadership opportunities in collaborative academic and clinical settings. While in the early stages of my research journey, I am highly motivated to develop a strong foundation in research methods, data analysis, and critical thinking. I am beginning to build practical skills through coursework and look forward to engaging in research opportunities that explore topics like human development, resilience, and mindfulness in stress management. I am particularly interested in understanding how to apply statistical tools to interpret behavioral data and design meaningful studies. I am committed to advancing these skills through hands-on projects, internships, and research assistant roles to build a career that integrates scientific inquiry with practical application in mental health.
